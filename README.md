🪓 Killer Axe – OpenGL Game

Killer Axe is a Python-based OpenGL game developed as part of a Computer Graphics coursework assignment.

🎮 Game Description

The game renders an interactive scene where the player controls the axe and there are villegers throwing stones at it. The player needs to avoid those stones and try to eliminate the villegers with the axe. The villegers are eliminated when hit by the axe and the players looses the game if hit by any stone.

It demonstrates real-time rendering, transformations, and event handling using OpenGL.
